# SCEDeffectsize
Wendt, O., & DePalma, G. (2012). R-code for non-parametric effect size metrics applicable to single-case experimental designs. West Lafayette, IN: Purdue University.<br />
This R-code computes the following non-parametric, overlap-based metrics for the estimation of effect size in single-case experimental designs:<br />
Percentage of Non-overlapping Data (PND)<br />
Percentage of Data Exceeding the Median (PEM)<br />
Percentage of Data Exceeding the Median Trend (PEMT)<br />
Percentage of All Non-overlapping Data (PAND)<br />
Improvement Rate Difference (IRD)<br />
Pairwise Data Overlap (PDO) <br />
Non-overlap of All Pairs (NAP)<br />
Mean Baseline Reduction (MBR)<br />
Percentage of Zero Data (PZD)<br />
